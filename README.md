# VEX V5 Inspired Bot

This project is a custom bot inspired by my experience in VEX V5 competitions. The goal is to design, build, and program a fully functional robot and ecosystem from scratch, with a focus on **3D printing** and **custom electronics**, all while keeping costs low.

## Goals

- Pick up and score **V5RC 2024–25 High Stakes rings**.  
- Pick up and score **V5RC 2025–26 Push Back game pieces (balls)** at the middle goal height.  
- 3D print **everything that can reasonably be printed**.  
- Build a full **control ecosystem** in `Rust`, `C++`, or `C` (language TBD).  
- Keep the budget under **$150 USD** for new electronics; use existing components first.  
- Include both **autonomous** and **user-controlled periods**, with a **custom controller** and **competition object**.  
- Use the **simplest electronics possible** while maintaining functionality.  
- Fully **CAD model and plan** all parts before 3D printing.  
- Use **PLA** for the bot structure where possible; incorporate other materials only if necessary and within budget.  
- **3D print the entire field** out of PLA.  
- Most importantly, **have fun** and document the process — this project is also intended to help with college applications.
- The bot must be able to fit into a 18x18 (inch) square parking space (Just the base)

## For me to consider myself done with this project I must have completed the following

- have a autonomous period that can score at least **2 rings** and **3 balls** in **45 seconds**. 
- be able to consistently pick up and hold 2 rings at a time, and hold at least 3 balls at a time.
- Be able to score both balls and blocks
- The bot should be structuraly secure and be able to 

## Notes

This project is a combination of mechanical design, electronics, and software. The bot will feature:
